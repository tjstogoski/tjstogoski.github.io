Hey! I'm Thomas, environmental professional and saxophonist. I work as a technician at [Banshee Reeks Nature Preserve](https://www.loudoun.gov/1277/Banshee-Reeks-Nature-Preserve), where I focus on habitat restoration and promoting biodiversity. I am also a student of the [Earth Data Analytics Professional Graduate Certificate](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate) through the Earth Lab at University of Colorado Boulder. Using modern Earth data techniques, I hope to look at vegetation changes over time.
